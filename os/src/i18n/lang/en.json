    "tips_apiUrl": "The API address is the API address of the model server, used to send requests to the model server. You can change it to another address, but you need to ensure that the model server can access that address.",
    "tips_contextLength": "The number of contexts can effectively control the memory ability of the model, but the larger the number of contexts, the slower the model will be, so it needs to be optimized according to the actual situation.",
    "tips_top_k": "Top_k is a parameter used in text generation models that controls the range of probability distributions considered when generating the next token. Specifically, the model will only select from the top k tokens with the highest probability, ignoring the remaining low probability tokens. This parameter directly affects the diversity and randomness of the generated text. The value range of top_k is usually a positive integer, including all integers 1 and above.<br /> Specifically, the minimum value is 1, which means that the model always selects the token with the highest probability, and the generated text will be very deterministic with almost no randomness. Maximum value: In theory, there is no upper limit, but in practical applications, there is usually a reasonable upper limit, such as 50, 100, or even higher, depending on the model and application scenario.<br /> Excessive top_k values may increase computational costs and introduce excessive noise, affecting the quality of the generated text.",
    "tips_top_p": "Among the parameters of the large model, top_p is a sampling strategy used for text generation diversity and controllability. It filters out the least likely tokens whose sum of probabilities reaches a certain threshold p, and only samples from the remaining tokens.<br /> The function of this parameter is to allow for more diverse generation while limiting the occurrence of extremely low probability events, thereby improving the quality and rationality of the generated text.<br /> When set to 1, it is equivalent to not performing any filtering, and the model will directly sample based on the probability distribution. The smaller the value, the stricter the filtering, and the generated results will be more concentrated on tokens with higher probabilities.",
    "tips_temperature": "Temperature is a parameter used to control the randomness of the language model's output text. This parameter affects the model's tendency to choose tokens under different probability distributions when generating text:<br />Low temperature (close to 0): The text generated by the model will be more conservative, tend to choose the token with the highest probability, generate more predictable text, have higher repeatability, but may also be more 'mediocre' or 'templated'.<br />High temperature (close to 1 but less than 1): Increasing the temperature will give the model more opportunities to choose lower probability options when selecting tokens, resulting in more diverse and innovative text, but it may also be more discrete, difficult to predict, and even produce semantic jumps or illogical sentences.",
    "tips_frequency_penalty": "Frequency_penalty is a parameter used in some language generation models to adjust the frequency impact of words in generated text, aiming to promote text diversity and reduce repetition by penalizing high-frequency words. The introduction of this parameter can help prevent the model from constantly repeating the same words or phrases when generating long texts.<br />Negative number: Reducing frequency penalty may increase the probability of high-frequency words appearing, sometimes used to encourage repetition of specific vocabulary to maintain coherence or emphasize.<br />0: indicates no frequency penalty, and the model generation does not consider the influence of word frequency.<br />Positive numbers: Increase frequency penalties, reduce the probability of high-frequency words appearing, encourage models to explore more diverse expressions, and reduce text repetition.",
    "tips_presence_penalty": "Presence_penalty is another parameter in language generation models that controls the characteristics of generated text, mainly used to penalize or encourage specific tokens (words or phrases) that appear in the text. Unlike frequency_penalty, which focuses on word frequency, presence_penalty has a greater impact on whether the model includes certain words, rather than just their frequency of occurrence.<br />Negative numbers: Reducing the presence penalty may encourage the model to include more unique words or concepts, even if they are not the highest probability choices, which helps to enhance the diversity of the text.<br />0: indicates that there is no penalty and the model does not impose any additional influence on the uniqueness of words during generation.<br />Positive number: Increasing the presence penalty, the model will try to avoid using words that have already appeared in the generated text, promoting the generated text to cover a wider range of topics or vocabulary.",
    "tips_num_predict": "Num_predict usually refers to specifying the number of tokens or prediction steps generated by the model in text generation tasks. Simply put, it specifies the length of the generated text, usually in tokens (which may be words, subwords, or other units depending on the model).<br />Minimum value 1: Indicates the generation of at least one token of text, which may not be meaningful in practical applications unless the output of the model is highly structured and a single token can constitute complete information.<br />Maximum value of 5000: Maximum generated length, suitable for generating shorter text segments such as short answers, summaries, or short sentences. In practical applications, the specific range of num_predict values should be set based on the model's capabilities, the requirements of the application scenario, and resource constraints such as computational costs and response time. For tasks that require generating longer text, such as article creation, story generation, etc., the upper limit of num_predict may be set higher, such as hundreds or even thousands. However, it should be noted that as the generation length increases, not only will the computational cost increase, but the coherence and quality control of the generated text will also become more complex.",
    "tips_num_keep": "The value of num_keep can affect the correlation and coherence between the generated text and the original input. A larger num_keep value helps maintain continuity and consistency between the generated content and input, while a smaller value may allow the model to generate more free and varied text."
